#A Bit Wordy - Core

This is the basis of an engine for making word games.

It contains the word list which comes from the [Moby Words](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3201) project on [Project Gutenberg](http://www.gutenberg.org).


I'm just getting started, so not much to see here yet.

When I'm done I'll make a few variations on word games using this core.

The open source version here is released under the GPL. You may use it as long as you are making
your source free (libre).
